This project is a user-space TCP/IP stack implementation written in C++. It provides basic networking protocol handling including Ethernet frame processing, IPv4 packet handling, and TCP segment management with state machine support.

⚠️ DISCLAIMER: UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
This TCP/IP stack implementation is currently in active development and is NOT production-ready. It is missing critical security features, error handling, and protocol completeness. Do not use this in any production environment, for real networking applications, or for handling sensitive data. This project is intended for educational and experimental purposes only.
